# Town of Salem Role Checker

# Purpose
This is a web application that was built for the game Town of Salem. It will make "mayor games" much easier and removes the barrier of entry when it comes to remembering which alignment each role belongs to.

# How to use
Clone/download repo then simply open index.html. So long as you have the jQuery and Materialize libraries cached/access to the internet the page will load with a self explanatory interface.
